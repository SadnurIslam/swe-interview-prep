notes:
LENGTH() → counts bytes
CHAR_LENGTH() → counts characters

example:
If content = "Hello😊"
LENGTH() → maybe 9 bytes
CHAR_LENGTH() → 6 characters


code:
i)  select tweet_id from Tweets where LENGTH(content)>15
ii) select tweet_id from Tweets where CHAR_LENGTH(content)>15

option (ii) is safe , but both are accepted for this problem.
